Funambol - Technical Discussion Prompt<br>
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a prototype for a puzzle game. <br>

● We want to create a 3x3 grid puzzle with square tiles <br>
● The picture shall be retrieved from one of the following sources: <br>
 - the following url: https://picsum.photos/1024 <br>
 - a local asset if no network is available (you can pick your own asset for this) <br>
● To move a tile, the user shall select the tile and drag it over another tile: the two tiles will
swap <br>
● Once a tile is positioned in the right place, it is no longer possible to move the tile <br>
● When all the tiles have been positioned in the right place, the user shall be notified that
he completed the puzzle <br>
Bonus: <br>
● The progresses made must survive to phone orientation change <br>
● Good test coverage <br>
